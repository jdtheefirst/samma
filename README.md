street slang word for a flip, "sama"). Then making of cheni 6 curriculum began with "designing" of the tamati (sign out) pattern.

1st August 2013 (in Mombasa North Coast): Transformation of SAMMA to a martial art after the completion of the main contents of cheni 6 curriculum. 
Immediate formation of the World Samma Federation (WSF) to unify and voice for wasamma (samma exponents) worldwide.

March 2021: Introduction of samma pigano (sparring) method at Kenya Coast, that is; THREE ranges of man to man combat (stick, elbow, punch, knee, kick and finally grappling).

Samma is a modern hybrid martial art (from Eastern Africa) with its own training curriculum (cheni 6) and a distinctive sparring method that combines the three ranges of man to man
combat, that is; strike by an extension/stick, strike by limb (elbow, fist, knee and foot) and finally grappling.
